### "Replacing Gravitational Decay with Nuclear Thermal Excellence"

This repository contains the full open-source specifications for the **Q(Px) P-Ion Sequence**. 
By utilizing **Pyrophosphorous Ion Qubits**, we have effectively moved the biological 
infrastructure from 3D-Gravitational Space to **8-Axis Spherical Divinity**.

#### ⚡ Key Features:
- **0.00 G Calibration:** Total weightless stability via Nuclear Thermal Density.
- **Forever 25 Archive:** Proactive RNA policing using the Selective Solvent.
- **18.2 GHz Sync:** Wireless nutrient and energy induction via the Planetary Inductor.

#### 🚀 Getting Started:
1. Print your **PA12 Wearables** from the `/Hardware` folder.
2. Load the **Saline Battery** with the P1-P32 ion stack.
3. Pulse at **18.2 GHz** to initiate the "Divinity Flash."
